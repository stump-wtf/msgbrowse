# Architecture

msgbrowse is a Go application that imports on-disk message-archive exports into
one SQLite database and serves four faces over it: an HTMX web UI, an MCP
server, a journal generator, and a native desktop shell
(`cmd/msgbrowse-desktop` — a Wails window plus menubar tray over the exact same
embedded web server, ADR-0017). It is local-first and read-only with respect to
the archive.

## Layering

    ├── internal/mcp     Model Context Protocol server (tools over the store)
    └── internal/web     net/http + html/template + HTMX UI
```

Dependencies point inward toward `store` and `signal`; `mcp` and `web` are sibling
presentation layers that share the same `store` methods, so keyword/semantic/media
behavior cannot drift between the model-facing and human-facing surfaces. The
desktop shell embeds the identical server (same pages, same handlers), so browser
mode and the `.app` cannot drift either; `internal/onboardsvc` and
`internal/devsync` are pure-Go seams importable by both `msgbrowse serve` and the
desktop's embedded server.

## Data model (SQLite, one file in `data_dir`)

- `conversations(id, source, name, contact_id, is_group)` — `UNIQUE(source, name)`.
- `messages(id, hash, conversation_id, source, ts, ts_unix, sender, body, is_system, seq)`
  — `hash` is the stable content key for idempotent re-import; `id` is the FTS/cursor rowid.
- `attachments`, `links` — cascade-delete with their message.
- `reactions(conversation_id, message_hash, source, emoji, actor)` — emoji
  reaction badges, keyed to the message by stable hash
  (`UNIQUE(message_hash, emoji, actor)`), cascade-delete with the conversation.
- `contacts`, `contact_identifiers(contact_id, source, identifier)` — the unified
  identity layer; one canonical person spans Signal + iMessage handles
  (reconciled manually; see ADR-0003).
- `embeddings(message_hash, model, dim, vec)` — `PRIMARY KEY (message_hash, model)`,
  no FK (keyed by stable hash so re-import doesn't wipe vectors; multiple models
  coexist).
- `contact_facts(contact_id, fact, category, fact_hash, source, source_message_hash, …)`
  — AI-extracted, cited facts deduped per contact (`UNIQUE(contact_id, fact_hash)`),
  no FK to messages (provenance by stable hash; see ADR-0011). `fact_state` is the
  per-conversation incremental cursor (last message hash + model).
- `journal_days`, `journal_digests` (schemaV11) — the day-keyed AI-editorialized
  journal (ADR-0023): `journal_days` is the deterministic mechanical rollup
  (message/conversation counts, per-source counts, top senders), `journal_digests`
  the optional cached LLM prose digest, versioned by `(model, prompt_version)` so a
  model swap or `journal.digest_prompt` edit re-derives affected days. Days are
  bucketed in UTC; no FK to messages (same rationale as embeddings/contact_facts —
  re-ingest rewrites message rowids).
- `spam_findings`, `spam_senders`, `spam_events`, `spam_state` (schemaV18) — the
  unsolicited-contact evidence layer (ADR-0029): per-message scan results stamped
  with a `ruleset_version` (a digest of the `spam:` config, so a rule change
  re-derives rather than mixing generations), the non-contact counterparties and
  the human judgments recorded about them (status / suspected entity / consent —
  columns a scan may never overwrite), the opt-outs and complaints, and the
  per-conversation hash cursor. FK-less for the same reason as `embeddings` and
  `contact_facts`. `is_after_optout` is recomputed WHOLESALE after every scan and
  every recorded opt-out, never incrementally.
- `snapshots`, `ingest_state`, `ingest_runs` — backup inventory + incremental
  bookkeeping + per-run summaries.
- `paired_devices`, `sync_state` — device sync (ADR-0021): the explicitly
  paired Syncthing peers (device-ID fingerprint, per-source importer/replica
  roles) and per-folder re-ingest bookkeeping (folder↔source mapping + last
  re-ingest time).
- `messages_fts` — FTS5 external-content table kept in sync by triggers.

Schema changes go through the versioned migration runner (`internal/store/migrations.go`),
which applies each version in its own transaction and records `PRAGMA user_version`.

## Import pipeline

`signal-import` walks `export/<conv>/chat.md`, skipping unchanged files via
`(mtime, size)` then content hash recorded in `ingest_state` (`--full` forces a
rescan). Each changed conversation is parsed (streaming, malformed lines logged
and skipped — never fatal) and its messages atomically replaced in one
transaction. Re-import is idempotent; messages are keyed by a content hash with a
sequence disambiguator for byte-identical lines. The `.snapshots/*.tar`
inventory is refreshed by filename/size only.

## Search

- **Keyword**: SQLite FTS5 (`bm25` ranking), filterable by conversation, source,
  sender, date, has-attachment/has-link. Snippets are highlighted safely (the
  store emits control-char markers; the web layer escapes then swaps them for
  `<mark>`).
- **Semantic**: per-message embeddings via the LLM, searched with a brute-force
  cosine scan over the filtered candidate set (ADR-0002). The MCP
  `search_messages` tool fuses keyword + semantic with reciprocal-rank fusion and
  degrades to keyword-only when no LLM/embeddings are available.

## LLM access

One `llm.Client` interface (`Embed`, `Chat`, `Transcribe`, `Vision`) backed by an
OpenAI-compatible HTTP client, pointed by default at a local LiteLLM proxy. This
package is the sole *internet* egress. `Transcribe`/`Vision` exist for the
media-first journal (Slice 6).

`msgbrowse spam` is the one derivation that touches no network at all — its
classification is deterministic regex/keyword matching, and ADR-0029 declines
carrier lookup rather than adding a second egress.

Two other network/process paths exist beyond it, both local: opt-in device
sync (`device_sync.enabled`, off by default) has `internal/syncthing` supervise
a Syncthing process whose msgbrowse-generated config is LAN-only — global
discovery, relaying, and NAT traversal all disabled, local (LAN) announce on —
connecting only to explicitly paired devices (ADR-0021); and
`msgbrowse export` / the Providers Enable flow spawn the upstream exporter
subprocesses, which do their own local I/O against the source message stores
(ADR-0020).

## Web UI

`net/http` with Go 1.22 pattern routing, `html/template` (auto-escaping all
untrusted message content), HTMX for partials (live search, infinite scroll). No
SPA, no Node; vendored htmx pinned by SHA.

Styling is **Tailwind CSS + daisyUI** (drawer/navbar layout, `chat` bubbles for
transcripts, `card`/`menu`/`tabs`/`stat` components) with a bespoke **slate**
(dark, default) / **slate-light** custom-theme toggle (ADR-0012;
`internal/web/static/theme.js`, self-hosted, persists to `localStorage`). Icons are vendored **Hero Icons** inline SVG. The stylesheet
is built by the Tailwind **standalone CLI + daisyUI** at dev time (`make css`,
no Node) and the resulting `app.css` is committed and `go:embed`-served, so the
runtime and Docker image need no toolchain and stay CDN-free.

A strict `Content-Security-Policy` (`default-src 'none'`, `script-src 'self'`,
`style-src 'self'`, `img-src 'self' data:`) plus `nosniff`, `no-referrer`, and
frame denial harden every response; media is served with correct
`Content-Type`/`Content-Disposition` and path-traversal containment. Everything
the UI loads — CSS, htmx, the theme script, icons — is same-origin.

## Containerization

Multi-stage `Dockerfile`: static (`CGO_ENABLED=0`) build on `golang:1.25-bookworm`,
runtime on `distroless/static-debian12` (`nonroot`, no libc, no shell) — fully
static since the SQLite driver is pure Go (ADR-0013). `docker-compose.yml` wires msgbrowse to a
LiteLLM proxy (optional Ollama behind it), bind-mounts the archive read-only,
keeps app data in a named volume, publishes the UI to host loopback only, and
hardens the app container (read-only rootfs, dropped capabilities, no privilege
escalation).

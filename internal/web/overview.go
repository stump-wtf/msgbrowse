// The Overview (the Messages landing screen at "/") consolidation — issue #1:
// beside the original hero + global stat strip, the home page now surfaces
// per-provider archive freshness (store.SourceCounts + store.LastSyncTimes),
// the semantic-search index status (coverage, last index run, live
// in-progress marker via the embed_runs heartbeat), and the MCP connection
// card that also lives on /settings — so "how healthy is my archive / how do
// I connect" no longer requires hopping between /status and /settings.
//
// Deliberate non-changes: /status and /settings stay the canonical URLs (the
// settings_subnav contract from #163 — "nothing redirects" — is preserved;
// the Overview duplicates, it does not replace), device pairing stays on
// Settings, and snapshots live on their own /backups tab (issue #2) — the
// Overview surfaces neither.

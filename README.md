[![msgbrowse](docs-site/static/img/hero-screenshot.png)](https://joestump.github.io/msgbrowse/)

msgbrowse renders a fast local UI over on-disk exports, adds keyword + semantic
search, and exposes an **MCP server** so Claude can answer natural-language
questions over your message history — every answer traceable to source
messages. Full documentation lives at
**[joestump.github.io/msgbrowse](https://joestump.github.io/msgbrowse/)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Nothing leaves your machine.** The web UI binds loopback only, archives are
> treated strictly read-only, and the only *internet* egress msgbrowse ever
> makes is to the OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint **you** configure (default: a
> local LiteLLM → Ollama route). Opt-in [device sync](#device-sync) adds
> LAN-only Syncthing traffic to devices you pair — no global discovery, no
> relays, nothing off your network. Encrypted `.snapshots/*.tar` backups are
> inventoried but never opened. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full
> threat model.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status:** working today — all three sources (import/browse/transcript with
> reaction badges), FTS + semantic search, media & links gallery, AI contact
> facts, the MCP server, a web UI that answers boosted navigations in ~20 ms
> on a 400k-message archive, the [desktop app](#desktop-app) with menubar
> residency ([#97](https://github.com/joestump/msgbrowse/issues/97)),
> [QR device pairing + archive sync](#device-sync)
> ([#98](https://github.com/joestump/msgbrowse/issues/98)), and the
> AI-editorialized journal. In development: Gitea-primary release publishing
> ([#99](https://github.com/joestump/msgbrowse/issues/99)).

> [!WARNING]
> **Alpha software** — expect rough edges while this is under active testing.
> If you're on the **macOS desktop app**, the `.app` is only ad-hoc signed
> (Developer ID notarization is pending), so Gatekeeper blocks the first
> launch. Before opening it, run:
> ```
> xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine msgbrowse.app
> ```
> See [Desktop app](#desktop-app) for the full explanation and the GUI-only

## Install

### Homebrew (preferred)

```sh
brew tap stump-wtf/tap
brew install msgbrowse
```

The formula builds from source, so the binary is compiled on your machine and
never picks up macOS's `com.apple.quarantine` attribute — no Gatekeeper prompt
and no `xattr -d` dance.

> **macOS:** reading live iMessage data means reading
> `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`, which requires **Full Disk Access** for your
> terminal (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access). That is a
> separate macOS permission from Gatekeeper, and no install method avoids it.

### `go install`

Requires **Go 1.25+** — and nothing else. The SQLite driver is pure Go (FTS5
built in), so there is **no C toolchain and no build tag** to deal with.

```sh
go install github.com/joestump/msgbrowse/cmd/msgbrowse@latest
# msgbrowse lands in $(go env GOBIN) (or $(go env GOPATH)/bin) — put that on $PATH
```

## Quickstart

```sh
# point at whichever archives you have (any subset works):
msgbrowse --data-dir ./data \
  --archive-root          ~/"Managed Files/Signal-Archive" \
  --imessage-archive-root ~/"Managed Files/iMessage-Archive" \
  --whatsapp-archive-root ~/"Managed Files/WhatsApp-Archive" \
  import

msgbrowse --data-dir ./data doctor   # setup diagnostics: roots, media health, exporters
msgbrowse --data-dir ./data embed    # optional; needs an LLM endpoint
msgbrowse --data-dir ./data serve    # auto-opens http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Archive roots can also live in config/env (see
[Configuration](#configuration-reference)). Imports share one database and are
**incremental and idempotent** — re-run after each new export. `embed` computes
vectors for semantic search; browsing and keyword search work without any LLM.

> [!TIP]
> Prefer clicking to typing? The web UI ships a guided setup surface:
> **Settings → Providers** detects Signal, iMessage, and WhatsApp on the
> machine and runs the export + import for each source with one click (Enable
> once, Refresh any time); exporter run logs live under **Settings → Logs**.
> The macOS [desktop app](#desktop-app) bundles the exporters, so that path
> needs no installs at all. `msgbrowse sync` is the CLI equivalent — the whole
> export → import → media → embed → facts pipeline in one command.

> [!TIP]
> Run `msgbrowse doctor` after every setup change. It validates the data dir,
> schema, archive roots, attachment health, image converter, embeddings, and
> exporter availability — and its hints name the exact flag or command that
> fixes each finding. `--check-llm` adds an endpoint reachability probe.

> [!WARNING]
> **iMessage exports must copy attachments.** Run `imessage-exporter` with
> `-c clone` (and grant your terminal Full Disk Access), or the export contains
> absolute `~/Library/...` references and every image renders broken. The same
> applies to WhatsApp: the Mac companion app syncs a shallow media set, so
> expect placeholders until you export from a full iPhone backup. `doctor`
> detects both conditions and prints the fix.

> [!TIP]
> **LLM endpoint.** msgbrowse only talks to **your own** OpenAI-compatible
> endpoint — set `MSGBROWSE_LLM_BASE_URL` (`…/v1`) and `MSGBROWSE_LLM_API_KEY`.
> Until one is reachable, `embed`, `facts`, and the journal fail; everything
> else works. No proxy? The Docker path below can run a bundled local
> LiteLLM → Ollama for you.

### Use it from Claude (MCP over stdio)

`msgbrowse mcp` speaks stdio, so any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code,
…) can launch the installed binary directly. Run `msgbrowse embed` first so
semantic search has vectors, then add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msgbrowse": {
      "command": "msgbrowse",
      "args": ["--data-dir", "/absolute/path/to/data", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use the absolute binary path (e.g. `/home/you/go/bin/msgbrowse`) if it isn't on
the client's `PATH`. See [Connecting Claude (MCP)](#connecting-claude-mcp).

## Alternative: Docker

Prefer containers? msgbrowse ships a Dockerfile and a compose stack — the image
is a fully static binary on a distroless base.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env:
#   MSGBROWSE_ARCHIVE_HOST  → your archive's absolute path
#   MSGBROWSE_LLM_BASE_URL  → your LiteLLM proxy (…/v1), MSGBROWSE_LLM_API_KEY → its key

make up            # build + start msgbrowse (points at your external LiteLLM)
make signal-import # import the signal-export archive into the local DB
make embed         # compute embeddings for semantic search (optional)
# open http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

`make logs` tails the server; `make down` stops the stack. The archive is
mounted read-only, app data lives in a named volume, and the UI is published to
host loopback only.

> [!TIP]
> No LiteLLM proxy? Run the **bundled** local one (LiteLLM → Ollama) with
> `make up-bundled` and `MSGBROWSE_LLM_BASE_URL=http://litellm:4000/v1`, then
> uncomment the `ollama` service in `docker-compose.yml` and pull models:
> `docker compose exec ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text` / `… pull llama3.1`.
> If LiteLLM runs on the Docker host instead, use
> `http://host.docker.internal:4000/v1`.

## Desktop app

msgbrowse also ships as a native desktop app (the `msgbrowse` app — same
product, native window): a
[Wails v2](https://wails.io) window over the exact same embedded web server —
same pages, same handlers, zero divergence from `msgbrowse serve`. Webview
shells can't be cross-compiled, so per-OS artifacts are built by a CI matrix
([`desktop.yml`](.github/workflows/desktop.yml)) on `v*` tags and downloadable
from those workflow runs. Browser mode (`msgbrowse serve`) remains the
universal fallback on every platform.

**Bundled exporter toolchain (macOS).** The macOS `.app` embeds the three
upstream exporters under `Contents/Resources/tools` — a relocatable Python
runtime (python-build-standalone) plus a venv with
[`signal-export`](https://github.com/carderne/signal-export) and
[`whatsapp-chat-exporter`](https://github.com/KnugiHK/WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter),
and the [`imessage-exporter`](https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter)
native binary — so a fresh Mac with no Homebrew and no Python can export and
import offline, with no manual tool installs. The app resolves those bundled
paths directly and never consults `$PATH`
([ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-bundled-exporters-guided-setup.md),
[SPEC-0013](docs/openspec/specs/desktop-onboarding/spec.md)). The `.app` also
bundles a pinned, integrity-checked [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) binary
as the [device sync](#device-sync) engine (browser/CLI mode resolves
`syncthing` from `$PATH` or `device_sync.syncthing_bin` instead). The CLI
(`msgbrowse export`) keeps its bring-your-own-exporter path — it still resolves
`sigexport` / `imessage-exporter` / `wtsexporter` from `$PATH` or your
`--*-bin` overrides — so advanced users lose nothing; only the `.app` bundles.

**Signing status — ad-hoc today, Developer ID notarization pending.** The
shipped `.app` and every embedded binary are **ad-hoc code-signed**
(`codesign -s -`) in CI, not yet notarized with an Apple Developer ID (that is
an owner-gated follow-up — the real Developer ID signing + notarization steps
are already wired in `desktop.yml` behind CI secrets and activate the moment
the identity is provisioned). Until then Gatekeeper blocks the first launch and
you must strip the quarantine attribute so the app **and its bundled
exporters** run:

**macOS** — download and unzip `msgbrowse-desktop_darwin_universal`, then:

- **Terminal (required until notarization lands):** `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine msgbrowse.app`, then open it normally. This strip is what lets the ad-hoc-signed embedded Python and exporter binaries run as subprocesses; without it Gatekeeper kills them. Or
- **GUI:** double-click (it gets blocked), then System Settings → **Privacy & Security** → scroll to Security → **Open Anyway** next to the msgbrowse notice → authenticate. (The `xattr` strip is still the reliable path for the *embedded* binaries on macOS 15+.)

Either grant is one-time; afterward it launches with a normal double-click.
Once a Developer ID is provisioned and the release is notarized, no `xattr`
strip will be needed.

**Linux** — download `msgbrowse-desktop_linux_amd64` and
`chmod +x msgbrowse` (artifact zips don't preserve the execute bit).
The binary links the system webview, so the WebKit2GTK runtime must be
installed (Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13:
`sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0 libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0`; most GNOME desktops
already have it). Building from source instead needs the dev headers:
`sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev pkg-config`, then
`make desktop-linux` (on distros still shipping webkit2gtk-4.0:
`make desktop-linux DESKTOP_TAGS=desktop,production`). No WebKit2GTK? Use
browser mode.

**Windows** — not built yet; the matrix leg is tracked in
[#119](https://github.com/joestump/msgbrowse/issues/119). Use browser mode in
the meantime.

## Device sync

Opt-in, LAN-only archive sync between your machines
([ADR-0021](docs/adr/0021-syncthing-sync-engine.md),
[SPEC-0014](docs/openspec/specs/device-sync-syncthing/spec.md)): the Mac that
runs the exporters (the **importer**) replicates its managed archives to
paired **replica** devices — a home server, a laptop — and each replica
imports the synced copy into its own local database automatically. msgbrowse
supervises [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) as the transfer engine: the
desktop `.app` runs its bundled, pinned copy, while `msgbrowse serve` resolves
`syncthing` from `$PATH` (or `device_sync.syncthing_bin`).

1. Set `device_sync.enabled: true` on both devices (see the `device_sync:`
   block in [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml)) and restart the app
   / `msgbrowse serve`.
2. Open **Settings** on both devices and pair by scanning the QR code (or
   pasting the Syncthing device ID). Pairing is mutual — both ends must
   accept before any data moves.
3. Watch it work: `msgbrowse devices status` shows engine, peer-connection,
   and folder-completion state; `msgbrowse devices list` shows paired peers;
   `msgbrowse doctor` includes sync checks. `msgbrowse devices unpair` stops
   syncing to a device (already-synced local data stays).

The posture is deliberately conservative: with `device_sync.enabled` false
(the default) no sync process runs at all, and when enabled the generated
Syncthing config is **LAN-only** — global discovery, relaying, and NAT
traversal are all off; connections are mutual TLS pinned to the paired device
IDs. The sync listener (default `:8788`) is the one socket beyond loopback,
and sync traffic never crosses the internet. See
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full trust model.

## The data layout it reads

msgbrowse treats every archive as **strictly read-only**. The signal-export
layout:

```
Signal-Archive/
├── export/                      # the browsable, decrypted corpus
│   └── <ChatName>/
│       ├── chat.md              # the conversation, plaintext markdown
│       └── media/               # attachments for this conversation
└── .snapshots/                  # timestamped RAW encrypted DB backups
    └── db-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar   # SQLCipher-encrypted; LISTED, never decrypted
```

iMessage is a flat directory of `<ChatName>.txt` files plus an `attachments/`
tree (`imessage-exporter -f txt -c clone`). WhatsApp is the
`WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter` output — `result.json` plus the media folders the tool
copies. The [export guide](https://joestump.github.io/msgbrowse/docs/getting-started/exporting-your-archives/)
covers all three end to end, including the macOS WhatsApp-app route
(`ChatStorage.sqlite` without a phone backup).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `msgbrowse export` | Run the upstream exporters into the configured roots: `sigexport` (Signal), `imessage-exporter -f txt -c clone` (iMessage), and `wtsexporter` (WhatsApp). Tools must be on PATH or set via `--signal-export-bin` / `--imessage-exporter-bin` / `--whatsapp-exporter-bin`; `--skip-on-error` continues past a failing source; per-tool extra args plus trailing `-- …` passthrough. msgbrowse stores no secrets. |
| `msgbrowse sync` | **One-command onboarding**: the whole pipeline — export → import → media → embed → facts — in order. `--no-export` / `--no-media` / `--no-embed` / `--no-facts` skip stages (import always runs — it is the incremental core); `--skip-on-error` continues past a failing stage; embed/facts warn-and-continue when no LLM is reachable. |
| `msgbrowse import` | **All-in-one**: import every configured archive (Signal + iMessage + WhatsApp) into one DB. Unset sources are skipped. |
| `msgbrowse signal-import` | Import/refresh a signal-export archive (incremental, idempotent). |
| `msgbrowse imessage-import` | Import/refresh an imessage-exporter archive (`-f txt`, 4.2.0). |
| `msgbrowse whatsapp-import` | Import/refresh a WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter JSON archive. |
| `msgbrowse doctor` | Read-only setup diagnostics across all sources — catches non-copy-mode exports, absolute media paths, missing converters, schema drift. `--check-llm` probes the endpoint. Exits non-zero only on a ✗. |
| `msgbrowse embed` | Compute embeddings for new messages (semantic search). `--prune` reclaims orphans. |
| `msgbrowse facts` | Extract AI facts about each contact (incremental, cited; shown on the conversation page). `--reset` rebuilds. |
| `msgbrowse media` | Transcode non-web images (HEIC/TIFF) to cached JPEGs for the gallery. Incremental; `import` runs it automatically. |
| `msgbrowse serve` | Run the local HTMX web UI. `--port`/`--host` (or `--listen-addr`); `--open=false` for headless. Default `127.0.0.1:8787`. |
| `msgbrowse mcp` | Run the MCP server (stdio by default; `--http` for streamable HTTP). |
| `msgbrowse devices` | Manage [device-sync](#device-sync) peers: `list` paired devices, `unpair <device-id>` (stop syncing; local data stays), `status` (engine, peer connections, folder completion). |
| `msgbrowse journal` | Build the per-day journal: a deterministic local rollup (message/conversation counts, per-source counts, top senders) plus one optional LLM prose digest per day (cached, versioned by model+prompt), surfaced at `/journal` and from the home-page **Journal** tile. Incremental (only days without a current digest) and resumable. `--since YYYY-MM-DD` floors the range; `--backfill` digests oldest-first; `--regenerate` clears cached digests and re-derives every day; `--dry-run` reports the eligible day count + a rough token estimate without calling the LLM. |
| `msgbrowse version` | Print version. |

## Connecting Claude (MCP)

msgbrowse exposes citation-faithful retrieval tools (`search_messages` [hybrid
keyword+vector], `semantic_search`, `get_conversation`, `list_conversations`,
`get_context`, `list_media`, `list_links`). Run `msgbrowse embed` first so
semantic search has vectors.

**Claude Desktop / Claude Code** — add to your MCP config
(`claude_desktop_config.json` or the Claude Code MCP settings):

Local binary (stdio) — the `go install` path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msgbrowse": {
      "command": "msgbrowse",
      "args": ["--data-dir", "/absolute/path/to/data", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Via Docker (stdio; reuses the compose data volume):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msgbrowse": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["compose", "-f", "/absolute/path/to/msgbrowse/docker-compose.yml",
               "run", "--rm", "-T", "msgbrowse", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask Claude things like *"what did MJ say about the lease?"* or *"summarize
my thread with Harper about the trip."* Every answer can be traced to source
messages (conversation, sender, timestamp, message id).

## Security

Loopback-only by default, archives mounted read-only, container runs non-root
with a read-only root filesystem and all capabilities dropped, the encrypted
`.snapshots` are never opened, and the **only** outbound internet call is to
your configured `llm.base_url`. Opt-in [device sync](#device-sync) adds
LAN-only Syncthing connections to explicitly paired devices — mutual TLS,
no global discovery, no relays.

> [!CAUTION]
> Pointing `llm.base_url` at a **hosted** model means message text (and, if you
> enable captioning/transcription, media) leaves your machine for that
> provider. Keep it local if that matters to you — that's the default. Read
> [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the exact data-sent-to-the-LLM boundary.

## Scheduling daily exports with Claude Cowork

You don't need Cowork to create an archive anymore — the **Settings →
Providers** page (one-click Enable/Refresh, exporters bundled in the macOS
app) and the `msgbrowse export` / `msgbrowse sync` commands run the exporters
directly. What the prompts below add is **unattended freshness**: a scheduled
daily launchd pipeline on your Mac with timestamped snapshot retention, so the
archive keeps itself current without anyone clicking Refresh. If that appeals,
paste them into Claude Cowork. (WhatsApp needs no
scheduled job to start — the [export guide](https://joestump.github.io/msgbrowse/docs/getting-started/exporting-your-archives/)
covers the one-command `wtsexporter` run against the Mac app's local database.)

**Signal:**

```
Set up a recurring daily job on my Mac that runs `signal-export` to dump my Signal Desktop
history into ~/Managed Files/Signal-Archive, building a searchable, ever-growing archive.

Do it as a careful, in-the-loop setup — propose a plan and wait for my approval before
installing anything or changing system state. Requirements:

1. Discovery first (read-only): confirm Signal Desktop is installed/linked, locate
   ~/Library/Application Support/Signal (sql/db.sqlite + config.json), and check that the
   config has an `encryptedKey` (v10 / Electron safeStorage, macOS Keychain-wrapped). Confirm
   Python 3.11+ is available (Homebrew). Flag the known breakage point: recent Signal Desktop
   encrypts the SQLCipher key via the macOS Keychain ("Signal Safe Storage"), so the export
   needs a one-time "Always Allow" on a Keychain prompt; after that, unattended runs are silent.

2. Install `signal-export` in an isolated venv (not system pip): a dedicated
   ~/Managed Files/Signal-Archive/.venv. Markdown output only (--no-html --no-json), keep
   attachments.

3. Write a wrapper script that, each run:
   - copies config.json + sql/db.sqlite{,-wal,-shm} to a private same-volume work dir (avoids
     the live DB lock / "I/O disk error" without quitting Signal), and SYMLINKS the large,
     immutable media dirs (attachments.noindex, avatars.noindex, stickers.noindex,
     badges.noindex) so attachments export without copying gigabytes;
   - persists a timestamped RAW DB snapshot as an uncompressed .tar under .snapshots/ — note
     the SQLCipher DB is encrypted and therefore incompressible, so compression is skipped and
     footprint is controlled by GFS retention instead;
   - runs `sigexport --source <copy> --old <archive> --no-html --no-json <staging>` so messages
     that roll past Signal's ~45-day linked-device window are merged in and never lost;
   - atomically swaps the new export into place;
   - prunes snapshots with GFS compaction: keep all dailies ≤14d, then 1 per month (≤~13mo),
     1 per quarter (≤~3y), 1 per year forever — the oldest snapshot in each period is its
     anchor (~37 snapshots / ~12 GB steady state at a ~350 MB DB).

4. Schedule it with a macOS launchd LaunchAgent (~/Library/LaunchAgents/) running DAILY at
   09:00 in my user session (so it can reach the Keychain), runs without Cowork open.

5. Do a one-time interactive test run so I can click "Always Allow" on the Keychain prompt,
   confirm the markdown export + a snapshot landed, then bootstrap the LaunchAgent and verify
   with `launchctl list`. Lock down perms (archive dir 700, snapshots 600); my disk is already
   FileVault-encrypted, which covers the plaintext export at rest.
```

**iMessage:**

```
Set up a recurring daily job on my Mac that runs `imessage-exporter` to dump my iMessage
history into ~/Managed Files/iMessage-Archive in Markdown, building a searchable archive that
msgbrowse can import alongside my Signal export.

Do it as a careful, in-the-loop setup — propose a plan and wait for my approval before
installing anything or changing system state. Requirements:

1. Discovery first (read-only): confirm ~/Library/Messages/chat.db exists and is readable.
   Note that reading it requires the terminal/job to have Full Disk Access in System Settings →
   Privacy & Security; flag that as the one-time manual grant I must approve.

2. Install `imessage-exporter` via Homebrew (or cargo). Pin the version.

3. Write a wrapper script that, each run, exports to a staging dir with Markdown output
   (`imessage-exporter -f txt -c clone -o <staging>`), keeps attachments/media, then atomically
   swaps the result into ~/Managed Files/iMessage-Archive. Do NOT modify chat.db.

4. Schedule it with a macOS launchd LaunchAgent running DAILY at 09:15 in my user session.

5. Do a one-time interactive test run so I can grant Full Disk Access, confirm the Markdown
   export + attachments landed, then bootstrap the LaunchAgent and verify with `launchctl list`.
   Lock down perms (archive dir 700); FileVault covers the plaintext export at rest.

## Development

Full guides live on the docs site: the
[local development guide](https://joestump.github.io/msgbrowse/docs/development/local-development/)
(toolchain, CSS pipeline + drift guard, desktop builds, fixtures) and the
[macOS signing & notarization runbook](https://joestump.github.io/msgbrowse/docs/development/release-signing/).

```sh
make build      # build ./bin/msgbrowse (pure Go, no cgo, no build tag)
make install    # go install into $GOBIN / $GOPATH/bin
make test       # run the test suite
make check      # gofmt + go vet + tests (the CI gate)
make cover      # coverage summary
make css        # rebuild internal/web/static/app.css (Tailwind + daisyUI)

make desktop-linux  # build cmd/msgbrowse-desktop/build/bin/msgbrowse (cgo; needs GTK3/WebKit2GTK dev packages)
make desktop-test   # desktop module's headless tests (pure Go, CGO_ENABLED=0)
```

**UI styling.** The web UI uses Tailwind CSS + daisyUI with the custom
**slate** theme (dark) and **slate-light**, plus vendored Hero Icons. The built
`app.css` is committed and `go:embed`-served, so the **runtime needs no
toolchain** (no Node, no CDN — keeps the strict CSP intact). When you change
template classes, run `make css` to regenerate: it fetches the Tailwind
standalone CLI + daisyUI into a gitignored `.tools/` (no npm) and rebuilds. CI
fails if `app.css` is stale.

Architecture decisions live in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) and specs in
[`docs/openspec/specs/`](docs/openspec/specs/) — both rendered on the
[docs site](https://joestump.github.io/msgbrowse/architecture). Contributions
should keep `make check` green and add tests for new ingest/search/MCP
behavior.

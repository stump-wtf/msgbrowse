# msgbrowse Documentation

msgbrowse is a self-hosted, local-only browser, search engine, and (upcoming)
AI-editorialized journal over your personal Signal, iMessage, and WhatsApp
archives. It is a single pure-Go binary (`brew install`, no C toolchain) that
renders a clean local UI over the output of three upstream exporters
([`signal-export`](https://github.com/carderne/signal-export),
[`imessage-exporter`](https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter), and
[`whatsapp-chat-exporter`](https://github.com/KnugiHK/WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter)),
adds FTS5 keyword search and semantic search, and exposes an MCP server so AI
assistants can answer questions over your history. Nothing leaves your machine
except calls to the one OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint you configure.

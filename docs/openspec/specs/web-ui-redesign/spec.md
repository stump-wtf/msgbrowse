## Overview

This spec defines the "slate" redesign of the msgbrowse web UI: a bespoke dark
design system implemented as a custom daisyUI theme (+ a derived light variant),
a dense-log transcript replacing chat bubbles, and redesigned Home, Search,
Media, and Journal screens. All existing constraints hold: server-rendered
`html/template` + HTMX, no Node at runtime, strict CSP, system fonts, Heroicons.
The design handoff is the pixel-level source of truth; this spec captures the
testable requirements and the slate tokens.

## Design tokens (normative)

- **Surfaces:** base `#0f1216`, raised panel `#13171c`, navbar/sidebar `#161a20`,
  hover/selected tint `#1b2330` / `rgba(111,147,214,.05–.12)`.
- **Borders:** primary `#232a33`; subtle `#1c2128`/`#1c222a`/`rgba(35,42,51,.55)`.
- **Text:** primary `#dbe2ea` (headings up to `#eaf1fb`), secondary `.5–.7`
  alpha, dim/meta `.32–.42` alpha.
- **Accent:** slate blue `#6f93d6`; light accent (the "Me" name) `#9bb6e6`; text
  on accent `#0f1216`. Search `<mark>`: bg `rgba(232,184,75,.28)`, text `#f0d28a`.
- **Source colors:** Signal `#3b82f6` (pill text `#6f93d6` / border `rgba(111,147,214,.35)`),
  iMessage `#34c759` (pill text `#7bd88f` / border `rgba(52,199,89,.3)`).
- **Avatar palette (hash→index):** `#f43f5e #0ea5e9 #f59e0b #14b8a6 #d946ef #f97316 #6366f1 #10b981`.
- **Type:** system sans (UI); system mono for timestamps/filenames/counts;
  `tabular-nums` on all counts. Scale (px): meta 10.5–12 · body 13–14.5 · row
  titles 14 · H1 21–26 · home hero 38. Heading tracking `-.01em`…`-.025em`.
- **Shape:** radius rows/cards 8–14, inputs 8–11, avatars 50% (or 6px dense),
  pills 5–8, frame 14–16. In-app elevation via borders, not shadows.
- **Layout:** full-width unified header ~52px (amended by #190; originally a
  54px navbar), sidebar 320px, transcript column max-width 640px
  (680px editorial). Centered screen columns: Home ~780px, Journal ~880px. Use
  flex/grid `gap`, not margins.

## Requirements

### REQ-0006-001: Slate theme foundation
The UI MUST render in the slate tokens via a custom daisyUI theme set as the
default (dark). A derived light variant MUST exist and the header toggle MUST
switch between them, persisted to `localStorage` and applied before paint (no
FOUC). Numerals in counts/timestamps/filenames MUST use a mono face and
`tabular-nums`. No web fonts or external assets may be introduced (CSP holds).

#### Scenario: Theme applied without FOUC
- **Given** a saved theme preference
- **When** any page loads
- **Then** the slate (or light) tokens apply before first paint and counts render in tabular mono.

### REQ-0006-002: App shell — header

*Amended by #190 (shell redesign). Originally: a 54px navbar with the accent
home glyph + **msgbrowse** wordmark, right-aligned global counts in dim mono,
and a 34px circular settings button. The global counts moved to Status
(Settings → Diagnostics) in #152; #190 promoted the toolbar to a full-width
header owning the primary navigation. #238 added Journal as a third tab — the
surface had shipped with no link anywhere in the shell pointing at it — and,
because a third tab no longer fits a ~320px header, gave the strip an explicit
narrow-width behaviour.*

The app MUST render one full-width unified header (~52px) as a direct child of
`<body>`, spanning the window above both the sidebar and the content column.
It MUST show: LEFT — the below-md sidebar toggle and a contextual title
(**msgbrowse** on home/global surfaces, the active conversation name on a
transcript) that links home; CENTER — a Messages/Media/Journal segmented tab
strip (the primary nav), kept in normal flow and centered within the header's
available space so it can never overlap the side clusters at any viewport
width; RIGHT — a search pill (an icon-only `/search` link below sm), the theme
toggle, and a settings gear (the sole Settings entry). The header MUST NOT show
global counts.

Every primary surface reachable from the shell MUST have a tab or link in this
header; a route the application renders but never links to is a defect, not a
hidden feature.

Below the sm breakpoint the header MAY trade away chrome to keep all three tabs
usable, in this order: the contextual title, then tab padding and type size.
Whatever it trades, the tabs MUST remain reachable and the side clusters MUST
NOT be overlapped. Where the strip cannot fit and therefore scrolls, the ACTIVE
tab MUST be scrolled into view, so the current page is never the tab hidden off
the edge.

#### Scenario: Header tabs and contextual title
- **Given** an open conversation
- **When** the page renders
- **Then** the header shows the conversation name on the left (linking home), the centered Messages/Media/Journal tabs with Messages active, and the search/theme/settings cluster on the right — with no global counts.

#### Scenario: Three tabs at a narrow viewport
- **Given** a 320px viewport with the Journal page open
- **When** the header renders
- **Then** the sidebar toggle and the right-hand controls keep their full size and are not overlapped, and the Journal tab is scrolled into view rather than clipped off the edge.

### REQ-0006-003: App shell — sidebar

*Amended by #190 (shell redesign). Originally the sidebar also carried nav
links with leading icons (Search · Media · Journal · Status & backups); those
surfaces moved to the header — the centered Messages/Media tabs and the search
pill — leaving the sidebar list-only.*

The 320px sidebar MUST be list-only: a filter input ("Filter conversations"),
a PINNED section (when any conversation is pinned), and a CONVERSATIONS header
with a right-aligned total — no nav links. Conversation rows MUST be two lines
(avatar+presence · name · right-aligned mono count / last-message preview with
`Me:` prefix when sent by the owner, truncated). The selected row MUST show the
`#1b2330` tint and a left accent rail. Typing in the filter MUST narrow the
list. Below md the sidebar MUST present as an overlay drawer toggled from the
header; at md and above it MUST be pinned open.

#### Scenario: Selected conversation row
- **Given** a conversation is open
- **When** the sidebar renders
- **Then** its row shows the accent left rail + selected tint, and the filter narrows the list as typed.

### REQ-0006-004: Avatars, presence dots, source pills
Avatars MUST be a colored circle (6px rounded square in dense lists) with white
600-weight initials, colored deterministically from the avatar palette by a hash
of the name. A presence dot MUST sit bottom-right, colored by source (Signal
blue / iMessage green) with a 2px border matching the surface behind it. Source
MUST also be expressible as a colored pill (Signal/iMessage).

#### Scenario: Source-derived presence
- **Given** a Signal conversation and an iMessage conversation
- **When** their rows/headers render
- **Then** each shows the correct presence-dot color and, where shown, the matching source pill.

### REQ-0006-005: Conversation reader — dense-log transcript
The transcript MUST use the dense-log layout (NOT chat bubbles): a left mono
timestamp gutter (~76px, `HH:MM:SS`, dim), a 3px sender-colored rail (accent for
"Me"), and a content column (max-width 640px) with the sender name (12.5px/600;
"Me" in `#9bb6e6`) above the body (14px, line-height ~1.55). It MUST render: a
faint accent wash + accent edge on "Me" rows; centered day separators; centered
italic/mono system events; attachment chips (paperclip + mono filename + size);
link-preview pills; image placeholders (real decoded media in production); and
quoted blocks. Consecutive messages from the same sender within a short window
MUST be grouped. Large histories MUST scroll without loading all rows at once
(keep the existing HTMX keyset paging; virtualization optional).

#### Scenario: Dense-log row
- **Given** an open conversation
- **When** the transcript renders
- **Then** each message shows the timestamp gutter, sender-colored rail, name, and body; "Me" rows carry the accent wash; day separators and system events render as non-message rows; and no `chat-bubble` markup remains.

### REQ-0006-006: Conversation header
The header MUST show the avatar + name (22–26px/700), inline pill chips for
phone/email identifiers, and a meta line (`N messages · <date range>`) with
icon+count chips for images / links / attachments.

#### Scenario: Identifier chips
- **Given** a contact with a merged phone and email
- **When** the conversation header renders
- **Then** the phone and email render as inline pill chips alongside the message/range/media meta.

### REQ-0006-007: Home landing
Home MUST render a centered column with: the hero wordmark + tagline; a 3-cell
stat strip (Conversations / Messages / Newest message) with mono tabular values;
an "On this day" card surfacing a resurfaced message from a prior year (when one
exists); a "Jump back in" card listing recent conversations with relative times;
and a quick-links grid (Search / Media / Journal / Status).

#### Scenario: On this day
- **Given** messages exist from the same calendar day in a prior year
- **When** Home renders
- **Then** the "On this day" card shows one such message with a link to that day; absent any, the card is omitted or shows an empty state.

### REQ-0006-008: Search redesign
Search MUST show a large field, a wrapping filter row (conversation, source,
from/to date, sender, Has-attachment / Has-link toggles, accent Search button),
a results meta line with count and elapsed time, and result cards (avatar ·
conversation · sender · timestamp · source pill · snippet with `<mark>`). The
top/active result MAY carry an accent border. Live filtering MUST refine results
as the query/filters change.

#### Scenario: Results with timing
- **Given** a query that matches messages
- **When** results render
- **Then** the meta line shows `<count> results · <elapsed>` and each card shows a source pill and a highlighted snippet.

### REQ-0006-009: Media redesign
Media MUST show tabs (Images / Files / Links) with count badges and an accent
underline on the active tab, a filter row, and for Images a multi-column grid of
square cover tiles with a bottom scrim + mono filename; clicking a tile MUST open
a lightbox navigable within the current tab/filter set.

#### Scenario: Image grid + lightbox
- **Given** images in the archive
- **When** the Images tab renders
- **Then** square tiles show filenames over a scrim and clicking one opens a lightbox.

### REQ-0006-010: Pinned conversations
A conversation MUST be pinnable; pinned conversations MUST appear in the sidebar
PINNED section. Pin state MUST persist (schema) and a pin/unpin affordance MUST
exist.

#### Scenario: Pin persists
- **Given** a pinned conversation
- **When** the app reloads
- **Then** it still appears under PINNED.

### REQ-0006-011: Status & backups re-skin
The Status & backups screen MUST adopt the slate system (surfaces, borders, mono
tabular values, source-grouped runs) with no behavioral change.

#### Scenario: Status in slate
- **Given** ingest runs and snapshots
- **When** Status renders
- **Then** it uses slate surfaces/borders and mono tabular values.

### REQ-0006-012a: Journal screen shell (testable now)
The Journal screen MUST render the slate layout — daily editorial card (accent
eyebrow, prose region, People/Themes/Mood meta row), month strip, and per-day
cards — from a **stubbed/fixture** day summary, independent of the LLM backend.
This is verifiable at merge with a fixture and MUST NOT depend on live digest
generation.

#### Scenario: Editorial card renders from a fixture
- **Given** a fixture day summary (prose + people/themes/mood)
- **When** the Journal screen renders
- **Then** it shows the eyebrow, prose, and People/Themes/Mood meta in the slate layout.

### REQ-0006-012b: Journal wired to real digests — BLOCKED on backend
Once the journal digest backend exists, the Journal screen MUST render real
generated summaries (per-day, cached) over the raw messages. This requirement is
BLOCKED on the journal digest backend (roadmap Slice 6) and is deferred — it is
NOT counted against this epic's mergeable slices.

#### Scenario: Real editorial day
- **Given** a generated editorial summary for a day
- **When** the Journal screen renders that day
- **Then** it shows the generated prose and People/Themes/Mood derived from that day's threads.
